# Routed VIP trial

Run `sudo bash lab/bgp/run.sh` on disposable Ubuntu 24.04 with `bird2` and
`iproute2`. Two directors independently advertise one synthetic /32 to a router.
The trial waits for both eBGP sessions, disables the primary route, checks the
router kernel next-hop, then restores it. [Observed result](results/2026-09-26-route.json).
The disable command simulates withdrawal; forwarding health and BFD are next.
